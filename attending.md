WACA 2025 will take place within DisCoTec 2025, in Lille, France, on the Cit√© Scientifique campus, with main conferences at Polytech Lille and workshops in the ESPRIT building. 

The venue is conveniently situated near public transportation, with the 4 Cantons metro stop providing quick access to the campus. Travellers can reach Lille easily by train, with direct connections from London, Paris, and Brussels, and by air through Lille-Lesquin Airport. The city boasts an innovative, fully automated metro system that makes local transportation a breeze.

Accommodation is recommended in the city centre, which offers excellent metro connections to the conference venue. Due to the busy period in mid-June, early booking is strongly advised.
