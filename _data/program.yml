        Microservices is a way of doing agile architecture that is increasingly
        gaining popularity. However, if the microservices development is not properly
        managed, the teams development velocity may be affected, reducing agility and
        increasing architectural technical debt. This paper investigates how to manage
        the use of shared libraries in microservices to improve agility during
        development. We interviewed practitioners from four large international
        companies involved in microservices projects to identify problems when using
        shared libraries. We found that the participating companies had issues with
        shared libraries as follows: coupling among teams, delays on fixes due to
        overhead on libraries development teams, and need to maintain many versions of
        the libraries. Our results highlight that the use of shared libraries may hinder
        agility on microservices. Thus, their use should be restricted to situations
        where shared libraries cannot be replaced by a microservice and the costs of
        replicating the code on each service is very high.
    
    - title: Certification as a Service

      slides: presentations/paper2.pdf

      description: | 
        The development of industry 4.0 and smart energy ITComponents relies on highly
        standardized communication protocols to reach vendor-independent
        interoperability. The interoperability is required to build complex systems
        without vendor lock-in and stay in operation for many years without frequent
        hardware changes. However, the classical standardization and certification
        processes for such communication protocols are typically incompatible with
        modern agile software development processes. This increases the complexity of
        building microservice-based systems or cloud-native solutions in these domains.
        To cope with that, we propose an agile method for the standardization of
        communication protocols. We show that this approach will be compatible with
        agile development processes and present a cloud-native certification service
        that works within a continuous integration and deployment pipeline,
        seamlessly. This will support the efficiency of building microservice and
        cloud-native application for the industry 4.0 and smart energy domain.

    - title: Multicloud API Binding Generation from Documentation
      link: papers/paper4
      slides: presentations/paper4.html

          title: Authors
      description: |
        We present industry experience of implementing retargetable cloud API binding
        generator. The generator scrapes the documentation from the HTML pages, and
        generates typed Haskell descriptions, which makes it easier to maintain and
        easily scalable to both new cloud APIs and new languages. <strong>(Extended Abstract)</strong>

    - title: Teaching Complex Systems based on Microservices

      description: | 
        Developing complex systems using microservices is a current challenge. In this
        paper we present our experience with teaching this subject for more than 80
        undergraduate students at University of São Paulo, fostering team work and
        simulating the industry environment. <strong>(Extended Abstract)</strong>
